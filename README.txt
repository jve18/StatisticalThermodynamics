Purpose of this code repository is to create and collect scripts for computing useful quantities in statistical mechanics/statistical thermodyanamics. This is meant to be applied for further use in racting flow diagnostics, thermodynamics, combustion, propulsion, etc. This is also being developed to motivate reviewing the material learned in a statistical thermodynamics course. The key references used in developing the code will be:

Statistical Thermodynamics Fundamentals and Applications, Normand M. Laurendeau, 2005, Cambridge University Press

ME 50100 Statistical Thermodynamics Course Notes, Fall 2019, Prof. Robert Lucht, Purdue University

An ongoing list of topics include:
Calculation of ideal gas thermodynamic properties
	    Monatomic ideal gases
	    Diatomic ideal gases
	    Polyatomic gases
